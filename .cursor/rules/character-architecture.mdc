# Character Architecture

## Face Mask (Source of Truth)

- Built from a face photo that is **always facing up and the correct direction**
- No rotation or orientation correction needed for the face
- MediaPipe landmarks → face mesh + back shell → centered at origin

## Headwear (Swappable)

- Helmet, hair, etc. wrap around the face mask
- Lives in the `headwear` group — swap by clearing and adding a new mesh
- Each headwear type (helmet, hair) must be oriented to align with the face

```ts
const headwear = characterHead.getObjectByName('headwear');
headwear.clear();
headwear.add(newHairMesh);
```

## Persistence & Flow

1. User uploads face photo → face mask built
2. User selects headwear (helmet, hair, etc.)
3. Final character saved to **local storage**
4. Character used in additional steps (kart, racing, etc.)

## Scene Hierarchy

```
characterHead (group)
├── head (group)        — face mesh + back shell
└── headwear (group)    — helmet | hair | etc. (swappable)
```
